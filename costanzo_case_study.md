Robo-advisors are online investment advisors that are taking market share from traditional financial advisors and investment managers. They do this by using a fully automated online investment platform. The process begins when an investor, in the comfort of his own home, completes an online questionnaire.  Next, the customer receives asset allocation advice directly from the online advisor system. Then, algorithms perform product selection, automatic rebalancing, and trade execution.  Meetings with live representatives are no longer necessary.  The process is fully automated and the associated high cost of advisors and brick and mortar offices are eliminated.  The investor receives advice at a fraction of the cost of a traditional advisor.  Not only is it cheaper and faster, it is better.   Most Robo-Advisors use a passively managed allocation to index funds which studies have shown provide better performance versus actively managed strategies (seek to beat the indexes) of advisors.[1]   

*The Problem*

A problem for most investors today is poor performance. The recent results of the latest Dalbar study[2]  that calculated the performance of an average investor over a twenty-year period. If the average investor had invested $100,000 at the start of the period, he would have $214,111 today. However, if he had simply invested in the S&P 500 index, he would have had $298,455 or 39% more. 

What is the source of this underperformance? The answer is high fees and poor investor behavior. An average advisor may charge 1-2% and use actively managed mutual funds that charge an additional 1% on top of the advisor's fee. Trading costs and commissions add another layer of fees paid by the investor. Fees on top of fees means the average investor sometimes does not even know how much he is paying.                      

Human nature negatively impacts both do-it-yourself investors and financial advisors. DIY investors tend to buy hot funds at the wrong time and sell underperforming funds at the wrong time. They do not always use a solid strategic allocation and tend to be overly influenced by recent news. Financial advisors are no better. They often fall victim to the "great man bias". They believe they earn their high fees because they have the investment skill and knowledge to own actively managed funds instead of index funds, time the market, make impactful trades, and create excess return for their clients. If a new client comes to them with a diversified portfolio of index funds these funds will usually be replaced by higher cost, actively managed funds. Also, advisors face enormous psychological pressure from clients to "just do something" during times of market stress.  In many cases they are incentivized by revenue sharing and commissions to offer higher cost funds. In other cases, the parent company may require or "strongly encourage" them to offer high-cost in-house funds. The result is inferior performance. 

*The Solution*

Robo-Advisors eliminate these sources of underperformance. First, because of automation and no client-facing office space, a Robo-Advisor can charge as low as .25% of assets versus the 1-2% of a human advisor. Second, because a Robo-Advisor uses index funds, the investor can reasonably expect to match the underlying indexes, putting him far ahead of the average investor over time. Underperformance due to the human nature of an advisor is eliminated because the advisor is eliminated (in some cases). There are no hot funds for the investor to chase because he only has a few strategic allocations from which to choose. Automated rebalancing and tax loss harvesting are additional benefits. All of this can be done online from the comfort of home (no scheduled trips to the advisor's office). In sum - better, faster, cheaper.

*Overview*

Launched in 2010, Betterment is the largest and most well-known of the online financial advisors with $18B in assets and 250,000 customers.  Through its easy to use, online interface it quickly signs up investors, obtains information through a questionnaire and recommends a diversified portfolio of low-cost ETFs.  It has two offerings: 1) a low-cost option which costs .25% and 2) a premium, high end option which costs .40% and offers unlimited access to Certified Financial Planners.  They have obtained over $200M in venture capital.  Their initial product was strictly a low-end product without human involvement, but they have since added financial advisor access. 

Jon Stein founded the company in business school in 2008 and launched in 2010. His cofounder was Sean Owen, a software engineer. Later they added Eli Braveman, a securities lawyer.  Combined, the three of them had the right backgrounds – business, technical, and legal expertise - to launch the company. The idea was born out of Jon’s own investing experience and mistakes.  He had seven different brokerage accounts, was paying high trading costs, and was trying to time the market with little success. His performance did not match the performance of a passive investment in the S&P 500. He wanted to take the common human behavioral mistake out of investing by creating a simple, online, automated platform that would make allocation decisions for the investor. 

*Trends and Innovations*

Robo-advisors initially held themselves out as low-cost replacements for financial advisors. A fully automated platform could do everything a human financial advisor could do. Investors could save money by cutting out the middleman and letting algorithms determine a proper asset allocation. However, over time, some of the Robo-advisors began teaming with financial planners to offer a premium product. Those who invested more money and paid a higher fee could obtain access to a personal financial planner. To increase profits, Robo-advisors have also started adding checking accounts, high-interest cash accounts, and tools that let investors synch and track all their investments in one place.  They have also offered their platform as a service for RIA and 401k custody.  Automatic tax loss harvesting, rebalancing, and asset allocation are also standard robo-advisor innovations/features.  A key feature of the firms is their very low minimums which provide access to the many small investors that are being neglected by traditional financial advisors.

*Major companies in the field*

Several online advisory firms have already launched and can be divided into two groups: 
	1) the venture capital backed disruptors who pioneered online financial advice and,
	2) the incumbents who are responding aggressively to the disruptors. 

The Disruptors

_Wealthfront_, the second largest behind Betterment, was started by an ex-Benchmark Capital cofounder and currently has $11.5 Billion in assets. It also uses software and algorithms to place investors in diversified portfolios of low-cost ETFs using Modern Portfolio Theory.  The Chief Investment Officer is Burton Malkiel, author of A Random Walk on Wall Street. Unique offerings include a 529 plan and a portfolio line of credit. Their offering is fully automated with no financial planners. 

_Ellevest_, launched in 2016 is one of the industry's newest entrants.  Like other new entrants Ellevest is focusing on differentiation as a means to stand out from established firms.  They do this by focusing on women and their unique circumstances while offering many of the same features as the leaders.  Ellevest is run by Sallie Krawcheck, a well-known wall street executive. Working in conjunction with Morningstar, Ellevest uses Modern Portfolio Theory and Mean Variance Optimization to create portfolios. They also offer personalized investment plans and free tradeoff tools.  Ellevest has raised over $50M in venture capital funding. 

_Personal Capital_ is an online advisor that targets high balance investors at a higher price point. They manage $12.3 Billion. Unique to Personal Capital are the free online tools that can connect to other accounts so investors can view their entire portfolio. They have 22,000 clients.  Those with balances above $200,000 are assigned two financial advisors. Below $200,000 you get a team of advisors.  Fees are highest of the group at .89%.  Assets are invested in a diversified portfolio of ETFs. Like Wealthfront they hired a well-known name in the financial industry - Harry Markowitz, the father of modern portfolio theory, is an academic advisor. 

The Incumbents

In response to the purely online financial advisories listed above, the traditional investment firms have launched competing online products. Their existing client base and powerful brands have allowed them to grow quickly although much of the growth has come from their own clients shifting assets.

_Vanguard Personal Advisory_ has demonstrated how important an established brand can be for asset gathering.  Vanguard amassed $140 Billion in assets by offering online investment advice coupled with access to human advisors for a .30% fee. However, much of these assets came from existing clients and only the large incumbents can accept this level of cannibalization.
      
_Schwab_ has its own version of an online advisory. It has grown quickly but like Vanguard many of its clients come from the existing client base. Schwab's offering has attracted $10 Billion in assets and charges no management fee. It earns money primarily through the Schwab ETFs it uses to construct portfolios which have expense ratios of .07% to .21%. Schwab also forces investors to hold a large amount of cash (6.9% to 29.4%) which it uses to earn a spread for itself.

As a group these "Robo-Advisors" are taking share from traditional, high cost human advisors that charge 1-2%.  

*Target Market*

Initially, the target market was underserved, small millennial investors that do not meet the $500,000+ minimums required by traditional advisors.  Early adopters of Robo-Advisors are non-traditional, younger, digital-centric millennials with fewer assets, ranging from 22 to 40 years old, and 80M in number.  Millennials are the largest generational client base today. Their aggregate wealth is projected to grow from 4 Trillion dollars to 30 Trillion dollars by 2030[3] , yet surveys show most financial advisors are not targeting millennials.  Digital access is a natural extension of millennials online lives. Over time the target market has moved to more traditional, mass affluent market as this segment has become more comfortable with online investing.

*Industry Growth*

Business Insider predicts total assets managed by all Robo-Advisors will ramp to $4.6 Trillion by 2022[4].  To put that number in perspective, $4.6 Trillion would represent only 6% share of the total global assets under management of $76 Trillion.    

*Impact*

Betterment and other robo-advisors have changed the investment industry for the better. By lowering investment minimums and fees they have opened investing to people who otherwise would be neglected by advisors. Most advisors actively eliminate their smaller clients because they are viewed as a hassle and not worth the time and costs.  By using software engineering to automate customer onboarding and asset allocation, robo-advisors can accept the smaller investors with ease. Having thousands and thousands of small accounts is no problem for a computer but a traditional advisor would be overwhelmed. Robo-advisors have also forced the larger incumbents to find ways to better address these small investors.

A core metric for the industry is, of course, Assets Under Management. Betterment leads the way with $18 billion.  Another very significant metric, one very difficult to assess from the outside, is Customer Acquisition Cost, the amount of money you need to spend to acquire one customer.  Some say this number is relatively low while other analysts say it is so high that the industry will never be profitable.

*Recommendations*

My advice to Betterment and other robo-advisors would be to seek differentiation.  Do not try to outbank the banks with new cash accounts, debit cards, and checking accounts because you will just seem like another bank with a website. The robo-advisor industry as a whole should stand out from the traditional players.

One idea is to offer accounts that cost more but directly benefit children in that a portion of an investor’s fee would go to funding a child’s account. Imagine a grandfather with one million dollars using a traditional advisor and paying 1.5% or $15,000 a year in fees. He could move to a robo-advisor charging .40%, cut his fees to $4,000 while simultaneously funding a grandchild account at the rate of $2000 per year. After 25 years at 7% annual growth the accounts grow to $127,000, a great start in life. The result is the investor lowered fees and changed the trajectory of his grandchildren's lives (i.e., no student loans). Multiple small investors could aggregate their assets to fund a child.

There would be significant legal and regulatory hurdles to this since the SEC frowns upon moving money between investors but this might be addressed with Blockchain. By tracking where money is moving and being able to communicate this with the SEC, approval might be possible.  These kinds of innovations could help the industry more sharply differentiate themselves from traditional banks.
